      <h1>“Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.”</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        I always wanted someone to teach me how to live. I had parents, I just had a remarkably hard time listening. Maybe it was the rough relationship with my dad or the rough life in general, but I always wanted someone to teach me what to do growing up. The person I am today is from learning that nobody was going to be able to do that for me, but me. My parents certainly molded me into the man I am today; though I was a rough kid, I will be eternally grateful to them for doing so. Still, I like to believe that I had—and likely still have—more lessons to learn in life.

      <p>Through learning the hard way, I’ve taken down a few things worth sharing with the world (or whoever has a few minutes to read this).</p>
